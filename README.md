KSPInterstellar
===============

This is a fork of "Version 1.1" of the Interstellar mod for KSP version 1.2.2.1622.

I was not entirely happy at the time with the direction this mod was taking.

These notes should help anyone with compiling for the targeted version or for updating the changes made to the newest version of KSP Interstellar.
